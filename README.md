## Usage

### Research Question (a): Is the knowledge of how to interpret recursive NPs present in LMs?

In Section 5 of the paper, we take SOTA models finetuned on existing benchmark(s) of the same format as each RNPC task, and evaluate them on RNPC. 

The following steps allow you to reproduce our experiments.
If you want to finetune the models yourself, start from Step 1. Otherwise, start from Step 2.

#### 1. Finetune a model on an existing benchmark

If you want to finetune **Huggingface models** (BERT, RoBERTa, ...):

(1) Go to the folder
```
cd source/Qa/eval_on_RNPC/finetune_on_benchmark/other_models
```

(2) Set the relevant configuration in `finetune.py`

See comments inside.

(3) Run the finetuning script
```
./finetune.sh
```
The running log will be saved under `logs/` in the current directory. The finetuned model will be saved under `output_model_dir` in the root directory.



Similarly, if you want to finetune **GPT-3 models**:

(1) Go to the folder
```
cd source/Qa/eval_on_RNPC/finetune_on_benchmark/gpt3
```

(2) Set the relevant configuration in `finetune_gpt3.py`

See comments inside.

(3) Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY = [YOUR KEY FROM https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys]
```

(4) Run the finetuning script
```
./finetune_gpt3.sh
```
The running log will be saved under `logs/` in the current directory. 
The finetuned model be saved on the OpenAI server, which can be accessed using the model name. The model name will be printed to the log file.


#### 2. Evaluate the finetuned model on an RNPC task


If you want to evaluate **Huggingface models** (BERT, RoBERTa, ...):

(1) Go to the folder
```
cd source/Qa/eval_on_RNPC/other_models
```

(2) Set the relevant configuration in `config.json`
- `cache_dir`: the directory to store model cache
- `gpu_devices`: the index of cuda device to use
- `task`: which task to evaluate on

(3) Run the evaluation script
```
./eval_ft_models_on_RNPC.sh
```
The performance of all available models on the specified task (see `eval_ft_models_on_RNPC.py` line 82 for a list of available models) will be printed, e.g.
```
Evaluating models on MPTE: ...
MPE_bert
{'accuracy': 0.472, 'prediction': 0.48, 'recall': 0.44, 'f1': 0.459, 'weighted-F1': 0.472}
MPE_bert-l
{'accuracy': 0.415, 'prediction': 0.342, 'recall': 0.163, 'f1': 0.221, 'weighted-F1': 0.373}
MPE_roberta
{'accuracy': 0.511, 'prediction': 0.51, 'recall': 1.0, 'f1': 0.675, 'weighted-F1': 0.347}
MPE_roberta-l
{'accuracy': 0.509, 'prediction': 0.509, 'recall': 1.0, 'f1': 0.675, 'weighted-F1': 0.343}
```
The model predictions will be saved to `output_dir/RNPC/eval_models_ft_on_benchmark`, under the specified task folder.


Similarly, if you want to evaluate **GPT-3 models**:

(1) Go to the folder
```
cd source/Qa/eval_on_RNPC/gpt3
```
(2) Set the relevant configuration in `config.json`. Most fields are the same as the previous case, but there are a few more:
- `gpt3_model`ï¼šwhich version of gpt-3 to evaluate (ada or curie). We don't include davinci since it wasn't been open for finetuning at the time of the paper.
- `trial`: whether this is a trial run. If true, then the evaluation will run on only 5 examples. This is for debugging purposes since running GPT-3 is costly.  

(3) Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY = [YOUR KEY FROM https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys]
```
(4) Run the evaluation script
```
./eval_ft_gpt3_on_RNPC.sh
```
The output will look similar to the previous case.

### Research Question (b): Is such knowledge learnable with appropriate data?




### Research Question (c): What can LMs learn from RNPC?
We use [the code from the Amnesic Probing paper](https://github.com/yanaiela/amnesic_probing) (Elazor et al. 2021). Available upon request.

### Research Question (d): Is RNPC useful for downstream tasks?
