This directory contains the modifier lexicon. 
Each file represents a semantic category: intersective, subsective, and privative (See Section 2 of our paper for their definition). 

Each row in the file represents a modifier, with the modifier itself (e.g., "green") in the second column and the attribute (e.g., "color") in the first.
