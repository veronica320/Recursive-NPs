This directory contains the data for our inoculation finetuning experiment (research question (b) in the paper).

Under each task directory, the `train_{number}.tsv` files are the training data containing different numbers of examples (specified by `number`). 
The `test.tsv` file contains the test data. 

Note that this version data has not gone through our latest round of grammar check, so might contain errors. 

Therefore, it's only here for reproduciability purposes. Please use the data under `data/RNPC/tasks` instead for official testing.
